    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>What is this site?</h3>
    <p>I want to create a small business that I can do over this summer where I use my drone to take aerial pictures for real estate agents. I already have a decent drone that can take high quality pictures and many hours flying it with a good amount of knowledge in photography and photo editing. I want to use this website as a place to send realtors who are looking into hiring me. It will give them all of the information they need for the process, pricing, and contact information. The site will also be a place for them to see my work and get a better idea of what the pictures would look like if they hired me. I will also be able to make it known on this site that I have a certification to be flying a drone commercially. </p>
    <h3>First Topic/Idea</h3>
    <p>I want my homepage to be set up to show what kind of work I do and who I am. This can be accomplished by having a hero image similar to the rafting site but this one will be a picture of me with my drone. This will show who I am and set the tone for the website. My homepage may also have some of the pictures I've taken with my drone to show what my drone shots look like. I want this home page to have easy navigation to the other parts of the website and really give a good first impression. I think I can do this by being simple and minimalist in the design while still looking good and modern. This page can also include a link to see my certification or a link to a website to explain what the certification is. This page can also have a spot that shows the kind of drone and other equipment I am using</p>
    <h3>Second Topic/Idea</h3>
    <p>I want one of my pages to be dedicated to how I can help with real estate. On this page I will have images of houses I have taken and the process that would take place if you were to hire me to take pictures for a listing. This page would also be where you could find pricing and contact information. for example I could have a step by step process that would go as follows: I take pictures at the house making sure to get any specific images requested. The next step is to edit the photos and make sure they look good enough to be put on the listing. After this i will upload the photos to a goodledrive or other application for them to access the photos. I can also give them a usb with the photos on it as well. This will be the most important page on the website because it will be where they really decide if this is something they would want to do. This means I need to be clear in my process and how my pricing works and really show what sets me apart from others and why it's worth their time and money to get these pictures. I may have a section on this page that says "Why Me" and have it talk about how my pricing and process is simple, quick, easy, and quality. </p>
    <h3>Third Topic/Idea</h3>
    <p>Another page for this website can be for showcasing my best work with a drone. This will include a lot of house shots I have taken and just drone shots in general. This could also have a small part to show what I do when editing images but this could also go on the 2nd page when explaining my process. Somewhere on this page I can include one of the timelapse videos and possibly have it play on its own and look good where it is. I want to use grids in some way to make a lot of my images overlap at the top of the page in a cool design and have each image be a link that scrolls you down to a spot on the same page that explains the image.</p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>A website that I can send real estate agents to so they can become familiar with what I am doing and how the process would go if they were to hire me as a drone photographer. This website may also grow to become more than just a real estate website. I am thinking about doing 360 shots in houses to give full walkthroughs on houses for sale or also doing drone mapping for construction companies. These are all relatively easy things to do and i would be able to get started fast and set myself apart with a lower price because I am new.
